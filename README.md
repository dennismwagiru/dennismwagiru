## 👋 About

**Hey, I'm Dennis** - a backend engineer with a systems mindset. With over 6 years of professional experience, I architect, build, and scale backend platforms that handle high-load, mission-critical use cases across media, fintech, and digital infrastructure.

I believe great systems are built in **strata**—from clean code foundations to cloud-scale orchestration.

## 🧠 Philosophy

> “Simple is not about adding simplicity—it's about removing complexity with purpose.”

I approach software design with **intention and structure**, aiming to create tools that are robust, human-friendly, and secure. I believe documentation is part of the codebase, and that engineering must serve both the product and the people using it.
